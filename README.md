# *Module 5 Challenge: PyBer*
*18 July 2021*

##Overview

The purpose of this project was to utilize Python, and Matplotlib, in an effort analyze ride-sharing trends within urban, suburban and rural areas. The longitudinal summarization was then visualized through graphical representation. 

##Results

Urban cities are the highest grossing in regards to the total fares collected, and have the most drivers and rides per capita. However, the average fare per ride and per driver is significantly lower than that of both suburban and rural areas.

When visualizing the total fares collected longitudinally, the trends remain constant with earnings in urban areas out-preforming both rural and suburban areas.

##Summmary

Urban cities generate the highest total revenue in fares [$39,854.38 despite having the lowest average fare per ride, as well as the lowest fare per driver [$24.53; $16.57]. This is likely due to the shorter distances travel between pickups, as well as the frequency of trips. However, suburban and rural areas generate more costly fares per ride/ driver, though only a fraction of the rides [19%] occurred in those areas. Therefore, although individually rural and suburban areas generate more per trip, the demand appears to be localized primarily in the cities.
